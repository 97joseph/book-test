## **Prerequisites**
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **MySQL** (via XAMPP or standalone)
3. **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-review-app.git
cd book-review-app
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

#### a. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### b. Configure the Database
1. Open XAMPP and start the **MySQL** server.
2. Create a new database in MySQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE book_review_app;
   ```
3. Update the database configuration in `backend/config/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "development": {
       "username": "root", // Your MySQL username
       "password": "",     // Your MySQL password
       "database": "book_review_app",
       "host": "127.0.0.1",
       "dialect": "mysql"
     }
   }
   ```

#### c. Run Migrations
Run the Sequelize migrations to create the necessary tables in the database:
```bash
1.npx sequelize-cli db:create
2.npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

```

#### d. Start the Backend Server
Run the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

#### a. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

#### b. Start the React App
Run the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
